It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time
Uh oh!
I don't know about you\nBut I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright\nIf you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're 22, ooh-ooh
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming Instead of sleeping
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
We won't be sleeping
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
